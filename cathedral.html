    <h1 align="center"> Cool conjecture about money </h1>
<p style="border:solid; padding:20px; margin:60px">
<b> Conjecture: </b> Any positive sum economical mechanism is isomorphic to currency. Therefore the free market is the best way to structure society.
</p>

<p style="margin:20px">
What does this mean? 

A <b> positive sum game </b> is a game where you can score points without subtracting points from another player. Points can be created. This is how our economy works, this is why the total amount of value is increasing. You can create value, you can become rich without taking wealth from someone else.

</p>

<p style="margin:20px">
In a <b>zero sum game</b> the total amount of points is fixed. Gaining points means that these points have to come from another player. An example of a zero point game is status. Status is based on your position in the status hierarchy. If your position in the hierarchy increases you will have more people below you. They now have a lower position in the hierarchy.
</p>

<p style="margin:20px">
In life you want to play as much positive sum games as possible. Zero sum games tend to deteriorate.
In order to increase status you can also take someone else down. Any environment that 
measures value with a zero sum mechanism looks like a highschool. Think of academia 
(prestige based), highschool (popularity based), a big company (bootlicker based). 
</p>

<p style="margin:20px">
Positive sum games tend to lift people up. In (not-crony not-rent-seeking) capitalism, you can 
increase your wealth without taking it out of someones pocket by wealth creation. 
By inventing a new product or increasing efficiency you increase the total amount of value. Most
company founders love sharing their wisdom, a lot of them mentor younger entrepeneurs. They know
that they're playing a positive sum game and this leads to a wayyy better social environment.
</p>

<p style="margin:20px">
It follows that you want to base society on a positive sum mechanism. This leads us to the conjecture: any mechanism you can think of that is positive sum is equivalent to money. Isomorphic means that it behaves the same, that it has similair rules. If this is true then the free market we have now is the best kind of society we can create. Any proposed alternative will either be zero-sum (bad) or positive sum and is therefore the same as money.
